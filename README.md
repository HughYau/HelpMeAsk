## üîí Privacy

**HelpMeAsk respects your privacy.**

* The extension does **not** collect or transmit any of your personal data or chat content.
* When you use the refinement feature, your original text is sent **directly from your browser to the AI API provider you selected in the settings** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). HelpMeAsk acts as an intermediary to format the request but does not store your prompts or the AI's responses.
* Your API keys are stored locally in your browser's synchronized storage and are only used to communicate with the respective AI provider you configure.
